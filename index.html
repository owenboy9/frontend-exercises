          <h2>education</h2>
          <p>it is hard work to reimagine every single bit of your existence, just as it is hard work to let go, and
            grieve, and cut
            off the impulse to cling onto things known. one morning, ornello balestro realizes that his life-long misery begun at the dentist’s when he as a
            teenager
            got two
            incorrect wisdom teeth removed. he speculates away about how this original asymmetry induces subsequent
            asymmetries,
            dense disintegration. insistent entropy sprouting out of the embodied error and lack: trigger for
            displacements and
            misidentifications.</p>

          <h2>professional experience</h2>
          <p>it is hard work to be persistent in documenting it, and it does take some balls to face and to
            consciously
            unravel the
            meanders of the process. emerging from the soil of past cycles, mutation actualizes, in the present embodiment, an incalculable
            future. a
            time-troubling event that collapses the reassuring—though entirely imaginary—linearity of life as a
            sequence.
            picture
            this as an experiment in writing a present invaded by the future folded back on it.</p>

          <h2>programming skills</h2>
          <p>it is hard work to run all those miles, and to lift weights, and remember to take the appropriate
            supplements
            of diet.
            to cut down on tobacco. it is hard work to come out to friend after friend after friend. it is hard work
            to
            withhold eagerness, fear. a vast majority of your time sips into motionless staring at photos of your bare chest. you see himself
            for
            the first
            time, equally amazed every time, and for some reason you stay there, unable to snap out of the enthralling
            loop, as if
            this was a doing, an essential part of becoming, as if without the staring something risked being unmade.
