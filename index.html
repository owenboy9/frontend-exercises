            <p>it is hard work to reimagine every single bit of your existence, just as it is hard work to let go, and
              grieve, and cut
              off the impulse to cling onto things known.</p>

            <p>one morning, ornello balestro realizes that his life-long misery begun at the dentist’s when he as a
              teenager
              got two
              incorrect wisdom teeth removed. he speculates away about how this original asymmetry induces subsequent
              asymmetries,
              dense disintegration. insistent entropy sprouting out of the embodied error and lack: trigger for
              displacements and
              misidentifications.</p>

            <p>it is hard work to be persistent in documenting it, and it does take some balls to face and to
              consciously
              unravel the
              meanders of the process.

            <p>emerging from the soil of past cycles, mutation actualizes, in the present embodiment, an incalculable
              future. a
              time-troubling event that collapses the reassuring—though entirely imaginary—linearity of life as a
              sequence.

            <p>a vast majority of your time sips into motionless staring at photos of your bare chest. you see himself
              for
              the first
              time, equally amazed every time, and for some reason you stay there, unable to snap out of the enthralling
              loop, as if
              this was a doing, an essential part of becoming, as if without the staring something risked being unmade.
